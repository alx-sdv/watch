Is another try to make Oracle Database monitoring more handy.

This app created for people who have to deal with long-term sql queries. In other words, if you are data warehouse developer or admin, it could be helpful.

Oracle DB has an infinity number of system views which may give answers for questions like:
* Why does my query run slow?
* Which user consumes too much resources?
* What is going on my database right now?
* How many rows were inserted in my table?
* and many many others.

The problem is you have no GUI to work with these views. So, you retype the same query every time you need some DB statistics.
This app provides easy way to wrap a query to a web report and share it with your team.
Of course, it is actual if your company don't want to buy Oracle Enterprise Manager.

### Features
* Flask-based. Minimum dependencies. Easy to customize.
* Permanent links to all reports and objects can be sent to other people or can be saved to favourites in your browser.
* Defining permitted targets to each user.
* A bunch of predefined reports & utilities for creation your's.
* Background monitoring tasks.
* Interacting through [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) chat (notifications & commands).

### Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Flask
* cx_Oracle
* Pygal

### Installation
First thing you should know: cx_Oracle needs Oracle Instant Client. Installing it could be a bit painful, please read [cx_Oracle guide](https://cx-oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and [Oracle Client Guide](https://oracle.github.io/odpi/doc/installation.html). On Windows Oracle Client requires [redistributable libraries](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/winx64-64-downloads.html).

Then create a new virtual environment if you don't want to mess your python instance.

Install Watch:
`pip install git+https://github.com/alx-sdv/watch.git`

If you deploy the app on Linux, please, add sqlnet.ora file to /usr/lib/oracle/XX.X/client64/lib with parameter "DISABLE_OOB=ON". Otherwise you will not be able to cancel heavy queries. For other platforms this problem also can be actual, it depends on Oracle Client version.

### Settings
Open `/config/config.py` and follow instructions inside.

Please check your database account privileges. By default Watch is not going to modify any data, but for heaven's sake make all accounts read-only. 

Also restrict an access to critical business data if you find it necessary. All you need is to read system statistic views.

### Launch
Use `run.py` to run the application on internal web-server provided by Flask.

It is not recommended for production, so you can attach app object from `run.py` to your favourite wsgi server.

See the official [Flask docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/deploying/#deployment), it contains a lot of scenarios to deploy flask-based application.

Test scan speed | Performs full scan query over chosen table.

And some tasks:

Task | Description
---- | -----------
SQL execution | Notify when specified query will be finished.
Queued SQL | Notify if some query has been queued too long.
SQL concurrency | To monitor average concurrency time.
Heavy SQL | Notify if some query executes too long or consumes too much temp space.
Frequent SQL | Notify if some SQL statement executes too often.
SQL error | Notify if some query has failed. It is based on sql monitor, but a trigger on servererror is much better.
Session activity | Notify when specified session will be inactive (for example, when the client has got first portion of rows). 
Session stats | To monitor session stat params.
Uncommitted transactions | Notify when somebody has an inactive session containing locks.
Zombie sessions | Notify if some sessions do nothing but still are active.
Temp usage | Notify when free temp space ends up.
Tabspace usage | Notify when some tablespace becomes full.
Recycled space | Notify to take out the trash.
Segment size | Notify when segment (table, index, ...) size has reached specified threshold. 
Watch status | Notify when specified table will contain specified row.
Resource usage | Notify when some of server resource usage reached specified threshold.
Redo switches | Notify if redo logs switch too often.
Logs moving | Notify if too many archived redo logs wait for deletion.
Job health | Notify if Oracle Job became broken.
Expired users | Notify if some user account expires.
Compare structure | Notify if some source column has been changed.
Ping target | Notify if ping to the target has failed.

All views and tasks were tested on Oracle 11.2 & 12.1 (single instance mode).

### Making your own view
There is two ways to add your code to the app:
* Create a regular flask-view, and do everything you want inside it.
* Use some provided conveniences.

Let's open `/views/target.py` and go to a function named `get_target_objects`.
```python
@app.route('/<target>/objects')
@title('Objects')
@template('list')
@snail()
@select("all_objects")
@columns({"owner": 'str'
         , "object_name": 'str'
         , "subobject_name": 'str'
         , "object_type": 'str'
         , "created": 'datetime'
         , "last_ddl_time": 'datetime'
         , "status": 'str'})
@default_filters("object_type = 'TABLE' and object_name like '%%'")
@default_sort("object_name, subobject_name")
def get_target_objects(target):
    return render_page()
```
As you can see this view does not contain any specific python code.

How it works:
* You click "OBJECTS" item in the main menu.
* Your request maps to get_target_objects: `@app.route('/<target>/objects')`
* The server returns the view page. The page is generated on "standard" template: `@template('list')`.
* The page contains these controls:
  * "Filter" field with default value: `@default_filters("object_type = 'TABLE' and object_name like '%%'", ..., ...)`
  * "Sort" field with default value: `@default_sort("object_name, subobject_name")`
  * Draggable labels for columns names: `@columns({"owner": 'str' ... '})`. Use in for sorting and filtering. Note that both values will be parsed before sending to database. See the main page of the app for more information.
  * Draggable labels of all preset filters.
  * "Run" button.
* You press "Run" button.
* The app receives your request with "do" parameter, and executes `get_target_objects`.
* get_target_objects call render_page function.
* render_page parses params, builds a sql query to specified table: `@select("all_objects")`.
* render_page sends the query do DB, then renders "standard" template with fetched data.
* get_target_objects returns rendered template to your browser.

You can make your own view in the same way. 
* If any additional steps needed, use `execute` function from `/utils/oracle.py` inside your view to send custom query to DB.
* To render "non-standard" template use `render_template` function from Flask.
* Put your view in a new python file into `/ext` folder.
* Add the view name in the menu structure by importing it from `config.menu` and setting a new key. `@title('<Choose a name>')` will be displayed.

### How to register a bot
* Add the BotFather to contacts and follow its instructions to create a bot.
* Send `/id` command to your new bot, it will show your account id.
* Set the bot name and token in local_config.py.
* Put your id into account properties (see `USERS` dict).
* Now you are able to get notifications an send some commands to the application.

### Making you own task
Watch task looks like a view, the difference is: it's code will never be executed in http request context.

Open `/views/task.py` and find `wait_for_execution` function:
* `@template('task')` lets the app know that `wait_for_execution` is not a report-view.
* `@period('1m')` defines default execution frequency.
* `@command('/wait')` is a command name that can be sent from a chat to register a new instance of the task.
* The task always must return two params: 
  * The first one is a flag of completion (if true, the task will be deleted from the task queue).
  * The second is a message that should be sent to a subscriber.
